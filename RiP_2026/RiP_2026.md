# Research in Progress meeting 2026
### Oxford - July 8th and 9th


The next Mineral Physics Group Research in Progress meeting will be hosted at the University of Oxford on 8th and 9th July 2026. Our Research in Progress meetings bring together post-graduate and post-doctoral researchers from all areas of high-pressure mineralogy & crystallography, mineral magnetism, molecular crystallography, computational mineral physics, geophysics, and planetary science to encourage the development of collaborations and sharing of results from recent research.

Further details will be provided in spring 2026.
