# Mineral Physicist and Geophysicist

**Hi, my name is Fred. Here you will find some details on my work and interests. My principal area of research is the key processes in the metallic cores and magma oceans of rocky planets which facilitate habitable conditions at the surface. I work within the  <a href="https://planetarycores.leeds.ac.uk/">  Leeds Centre for Planetary Cores</a> but collaborate broadly, so if you have ideas, I'm all ears! Feel free to send me an email or catch me at a conference. I am regularly at the AGU and EGU annual meetings and help organise the Mineral Physics Group Research in Progress meetings.**
