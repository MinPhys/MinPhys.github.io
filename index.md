# Mineral Physics Group

**This group was set up in 1996 and has the aim of advancing the understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical processes that determine the properties of minerals and brings together researchers from all areas of high-pressure mineralogy & crystallography, mineral magnetism, molecular crystallography, computational mineral physics, geophysics and planetary science. The group aims to stimulate interest in mineral physics by facilitating the exchange of information between members of the mineral physics community, running regular meetings where current research is discussed and provide bursaries so that members of the community can develop, undertake, apply and communicate their research. Follow us @MinPhys_minsoc  for regular updates.**
