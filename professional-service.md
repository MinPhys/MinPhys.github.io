## Professional Service
### Equality Diversity and Inclusivity
I sit on the Equality, Diversity and Inclusivity committee of the School of Earth and Environment at the University of Leeds. As a committee we contribute to Faculty EDI Community of Practice events, act as a task and finish group to address EDI issues at the School and Faculty level and act as the EDI points of contact for the School. In this role I have recently won independent funding to become trained as a Mental Health First Aid instructor. This will allow the School to deliver bespoke MHFA courses to staff in safeguarding roles, particularly fieldwork and student supervision.

### Mineral Physics Special Interest Group
As the newly elected chair of the <a href="https://www.minersoc.org/mpg.html"> Mineral Physics Special Interest Group Mineralogical Society of the UK and Ireland</a>, I coordinate an exemplary group of Earth scientists with a shared passion for mineral physics. We organise yearly Research in Progress meetings and help coordination of travel bursaries for early career researchers, both of which aim to promote and integrate early career researchers in the field of mineral physics.

### Reviewing
I take great pride in offering constructive and thoughtful reviews for my peers. It is an honour and a privilege to review for journals and organisations such as Nature Geosciences, Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, Geophysical Journal International (Outstanding Reviewer 2023), Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, Scientific Reports, the National Science Foundation and the L’Oréal For women in science award.
